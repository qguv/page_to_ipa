This script replaces all English words on a webpage with their pronunciation in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). Great for screen privacy! Many flavors available:

  - American and British English
  - rhotic (pronounces Rs) and non-rhotic (does not pronounce Rs) dialects
  - with or without stress markers

Go to Tools &rarr; Greasemonkey &rarr; User Script Commands&hellip; and choose your flavor to convert the current web-page!

All conversion happens offline&mdash;no information about your current webpage is sent anywhere&mdash;so this extension is suitable for security-sensitive environments e.g. Tor/Vidala/Tails or behind a VPN.
